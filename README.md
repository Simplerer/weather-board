## Description

This application was created as an approachable weather forecaster that is trimmed down to the needs of the average user. The data that comes to you after searching is direct and accurate coming from a public weather API which is also used by many of the bigger companies as well. A benefit of using this application is no ads! The true purpose was to build, from scratch, an accurate and usable application from bootstrap and a reputable API. 

## Usage

Here is an accurate weather calendar which gives real-time data and a 5-day forecast for any city you choose! All you need to do is search for you city and prepare your wardrobe to match the week ahead. The application will also keep track of past searches and allow you to pull that data back up seamlessly!
